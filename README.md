# 📘 Microservices-Based Quiz Application
## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **Microservices Architecture Quiz Application** built using **Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, OpenFeign, Eureka, API-Gateway, **and **PostgreSQL**.
It demonstrates how distributed services communicate to generate quizzes, fetch questions, and calculate results.

## 🏗️ Microservices in the Project

### 1️⃣ Service Registry (Eureka Server)
- Central registry where all microservices register.
- Provides service discovery.
- Runs on port 8761.

2️⃣ Question-Service

Handles everything related to questions:

Stores questions in PostgreSQL (questiondb)

APIs:

Generate random question IDs by category

Return questions by list of IDs

Calculate score based on submitted answers

3️⃣ Quiz-Service

Responsible for quiz creation and scoring:

Communicates with Question-Service via OpenFeign

Stores quizzes in PostgreSQL (quizdb)

APIs:

Create a quiz (category, numQ, title)

Fetch quiz questions

Submit quiz answers and return score

4️⃣ API-Gateway

Single entry point for all clients

Routes requests to microservices

Uses Eureka discovery for load balancing

Runs on port 2525

🔗 Communication Flow
Client → API-Gateway → Quiz-Service → Question-Service → PostgreSQL DBs

🗄️ Databases
🟦 questiondb

Stores:

Question (id, title, options, right answer, category)

🟪 quizdb

Stores:

Quiz (id, title, list of questionIds)
